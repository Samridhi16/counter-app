# counter-app
A basic Android application demonstrating the Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) pattern for managing states and events. In this pattern, user interactions, such as button clicks, trigger events that propagate upwards through application layers, including ViewModels or business logic components. These events update the application's state, which then flows downward to the UI components responsible for rendering. This ensures that the interface accurately reflects the current application state.
